This is the final project of the Aces team (Group 4) of the Women Techsters Fellowship Program, 2021.
We are building a model that would detect medical conditions and diseases based on predictive diagnosis by using large amounts of data to produce accurate outcome.
The MVP is a model that has been trained to predict whether a tumor which has been found in the breast is benign or malignant and would require medical attention.
The prediction model was built with Python.
The entire application was developed with ReactJS framework for the frontend, C# for the backend and SQL for the database.
Data sent to the database gets posted to the API hosted on SmarterASP, which sends data to the frontend on request.
This model would aid hospitals and other health practitioners by saving time, providing quick and accessible means to diagnosis, equip health care providers with affordable and scalable health care solutions, and thereby saving the cost of testing equipment in the long run.
The name of the application is ENVISIO.
